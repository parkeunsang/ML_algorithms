### 1-1. Introduction

#### Definitions

1. $\{X_t, t=1,2,...\} \ is \ stochastic \ process$

ex) A binary process : $P(X_t = 1) = P(X_t = -1) = \frac{1}{2}$

2. IID noise : $\{X_t\} \sim IID(0,\sigma^2)$
3. ACVF : $\gamma _X(h) = Cov(X_{t+h}, X_t)$ (stationary time series)
4. ACF: $\rho _X(h) = \frac{\gamma_X(h)}{\gamma_X(0)}$
5. 



### 1-2. Stationarity

> Its statistical properties don't change with time

#### Stationary(weakly) conditions

1. $Var(X_t) < \infty$

2. $\mu _X(t) = \mu$
3. $\gamma _X(r,s) = \gamma _X(r+t,s+t)$
